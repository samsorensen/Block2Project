- This program provides a GUI where the user can enter their password. A grade of 
either weak, medium, or strong, which is shown based on the complexity of the password.

- To use the program. First, clone the repository. Inside of the Block2Project
directory you will find an index.html file. Open this file in your browser.

- This tool is purely educational and should not be used to verify passwords. The 
implementation of the password checker is not thorough enough to be a legitimate checker. 

- This tool could give users a false sense of security. If the user is unaware of the simple
design, they may believe they have a strong password. When in reality the threshold
to receive a strong grade is simply inputting more than 10 characters.
